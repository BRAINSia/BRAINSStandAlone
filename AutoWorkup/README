Inital version of BRAINS AutoWorkup built on Nipype.
Currently very rough, use at your own risk!

To use the code, build BRAINSTools with ITKv4 on.

Then install the nipype version in the BRAINSia github account.

The file Template.config should be copied and modified to define the
experiment that should be run.

python baw_exp.py -processingLevel 2 -ExperimentConfig Template.config -pe IPL_ENVIRONMENT
