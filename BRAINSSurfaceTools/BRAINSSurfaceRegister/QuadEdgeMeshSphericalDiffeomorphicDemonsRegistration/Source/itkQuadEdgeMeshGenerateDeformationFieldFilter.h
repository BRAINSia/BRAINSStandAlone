/**
 * \class QuadEdgeMeshGenerateDeformationFieldFilter
 * \brief This filter generates a deformation field from an input mesh and a
 * list of destination points.
 *
 * This filter takes as input a PointSet, and a fixed Mesh, and assumes that
 * the points in the PointSet are one-to-one destination points for the points
 * in the fixed Mesh. Then, it computes a vector field where every node gets
 * assigned a (tangent) vector that points to its destination point. The filter expects
 * a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of the mesh and the points
 * in the collection of destination points.
