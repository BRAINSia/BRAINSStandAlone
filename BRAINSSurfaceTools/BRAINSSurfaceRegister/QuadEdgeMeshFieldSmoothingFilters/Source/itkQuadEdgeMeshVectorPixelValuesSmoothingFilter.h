/**
 * \class QuadEdgeMeshVectorPixelValuesSmoothingFilter
 * \brief This filter smooths vector pixel values associated with points.
 *
 * This filter was based on the filter provided by 
 * Arnaud Gelas, Alex Gouaillard and Sean Megason in their Insight Journal paper
 * http://hdl.handle.net/1926/1518
 * http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/313
 *
 * The difference between this current filter and the one above is that this
 * filter smooths the values associated with the points (PointData) without
 * changing the actual positions of the points in space, while the filter above
 * smooths the point positions while leaving unchanged the pixel values
 * associated with the points.
 *
 * This filter expects the PixelType to be of Vector type, where the Vectors
 * will have the same number of components as the space dimension. Vectors will
 * be averaged among neighbors by first performing parallel transport to the 
 * central node and then using a weighted sum. The smoothing process is performed
 * for a user-specified number of iterations.
 *
 * A full description of this filter is available in the TMI paper:
 *
 * "Spherical Demons: Fast Diffeomorphic Landmark-Free Surface Registration"
 *
 * by
 *       B.T. Thomas Yeo, Mert R. Sabuncu, Tom Vercauteren, 
 *       Nicholas Ayache, Bruce Fischl, Polina Golland.
