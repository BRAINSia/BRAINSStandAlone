README For BRAINSConstellationDetector Image Analysis ToolAuthor: Wei LuIntroductionThe BRAINSConstellationDetector project is designed for image registration, constellation (arbitrary landmark) detection, landmark visualization and manipulation for human brain MR scans. It is a subproject/plug-in for the BRAINS image analysis toolkit.For more information about this project please visit our homepage at NITRC.BRAINS:http://www.nitrc.org/projects/brains/BRAINSConstellationDetector:http://www.nitrc.org/projects/brainscdetector/
ObjectiveThis README file will guide you on how to 1.  Download the source code2.  Build the non-GUI version3.  Build the Qt-based GUI version4.  Run the softwareNote: A rtf version of this README file is also available athttps://www.nitrc.org/svn/brainscdetector/branches/wei-lu/MedicalSliceViewer/brainscdetector/docs/README.rtfYou will need a NITRC account to access this file.
Download the project source code1.  Download and install SVN client athttp://subversion.apache.org/packages.html 2.  Download BRAINSConstellationDetector source files from NITRC SVN repository by:svn checkout https://www.nitrc.org/svn/brainscdetector/branches/wei-lu/MedicalSliceViewer
Build the non-GUI versionUse bash script (in progress)Run the following command:mkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build bash ../MedicalSliceViewer/brainscdetector/buildTool.sh
Use CMake1.  Download CMake source file athttp://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html 2.  Build and install CMake (version >= 2.8)3.  Run the following command:
3.1  For Mac OSX 64-bitmkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build cmake –C ../MedicalSliceViewer/InitialCache-OSX64.cmake ../MedicalSliceViewer make3.2  For Linux 64-bitmkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build cmake –C ../MedicalSliceViewer/InitialCache-Linux64.cmake ../MedicalSliceViewer makeBuild the Qt-based GUI versionUse bash script (in progress)Run the following command:mkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build bash ../MedicalSliceViewer/brainscdetector/buildTool.sh
Use CMake1.  Download Qt libraries (version >= 4.6.2) athttp://qt.nokia.com/downloads 2.  Install the binary package3.  Download CMake source file (version >= 2.8) athttp://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html 4.  Build and install CMake5.  Run the following command:
5.1  For Mac OSX 64-bitmkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build cmake –DBUILD_MEDICAL_SLICEVIEWER_GUI=ON –C ../MedicalSliceViewer/InitialCache-OSX64.cmake ../MedicalSliceViewer 5.2  For Linux 64-bitmkdir brainscdetector-build cd brainscdetector-build cmake –DBUILD_MEDICAL_SLICEVIEWER_GUI=ON –C ../MedicalSliceViewer/InitialCache-Linux64.cmake ../MedicalSliceViewer 6.  Locate qmake install path for makefiles by for e.g. ccmake
7.  Run make
Run the softwareThere are two important executables: the modeler and the detector. The modeler helps the user to train his/her model with arbitrary landmarks. The detector will try to estimate those landmarks positions for a given new brain MR image.
Run the modelerUsage:./BRAINSConstellationModeler -i <trainingFile> or --trainingFile <trainingFile> Where1.  trainingFile is the input training files list filename without eye centers.For more details on setting optional parameters please type ./BRAINSConstellationModeler -h
Run the detectorUsage:./BRAINSConstellationDetectorNew (w/o GUI) or./BRAINSConstellationDetectorGUI (w/ GUI) -i <inputFilename> or --inputVolume <inputFilename> Where1.  inputFilename is the filename of the input image file.
A sample trained model file can be found atbrainscdetector/TestData/input/newT1InputModelWithVN4.mdlThe corresponding trained llsModel file can be found atbrainscdetector/TestData/input/llsModel.txt

After running the detector, a Slicer fcsv landmark file and a Slicer mrml scene file for those named landmarks in the original physical space will be also written to the working directory.

For more details on setting optional parameters please type ./BRAINSConstellationDetectorNew -h for non-GUI version or./BRAINSConstellationDetectorGUI -h for GUI version
Run tests (In progress)1.  For non-GUI version, enterctest -R BRAINSMSVNoGUITest_T12.  For GUI version, enterctest -R BRAINSMSVTest_T1
